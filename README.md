# Quasar echarts Demo

This repo is created for an article I wrote about how to add charts in the Quasar app. This code shows how you can add a bar chart, pie chart, line chart and scatter plot.

[You can read my article here.](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js)

## Project setup
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
